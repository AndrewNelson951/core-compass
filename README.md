# Core Compass 🧭

**Find your direction. Live your purpose.**

Welcome to **Core Compass**, a beautiful, private, and interactive tool designed to help you discover the values that define who you are. This isn't just about picking words from a list—it's about crafting an actionable roadmap for your authentic self!

## 🌟 Why Core Compass?

In a noisy world, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters. Core Compass helps you tune out the distractions and tune into _you_. Whether you're at a crossroads, planning your next big career move, or simply seeking more clarity, this tool guides you through a proven process to identify what drives you.

- **Self-Discovery Made Simple**: Effortless drag-and-drop interface.
- **Action-Oriented**: We don't just list values; we turn them into _verbs_ so you can `Live`, `Practice`, and `Champion` them every day.
- **100% Private**: Your journey is yours alone. No data is stored, tracked, or sent to any server.

## 🚀 The Journey

Your path to clarity happens in 5 exciting steps:

1.  **Discover**: Browse a curated list of values and select the ones that spark joy and resonance.
2.  **Organize**: Drag and drop your values into meaningful clusters. See the patterns in your life emerge!
3.  **Define**: Crystallize your groups by choosing a "theme" word that captures the essence of each cluster.
4.  **Activate**: This is where the magic happens. Turn a static noun (e.g., "Creativity") into a dynamic power-statement (e.g., "Nurture Creativity").
5.  **Manifest**: Get your personalized Core Values Manifesto. Copy it, print it, stick it on your mirror!

## 🛠️ Tech & Design

Built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and simplicity:

- **Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript**: No bloat, no frameworks, just pure performance.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A serene, modern interface designed to keep you focused and calm.
- **Draggable Interactions**: Intuitive grouping that feels tangible and satisfying.
