# Core Compass

Core Compass is an interactive single-page app that guides users through a structured values-clarification exercise.

The focus is engagement, flow, and reflection, not content volume.

## Inspiration

This project adapts a well-known values clarification exercise into a guided web experience.

The original exercise works on paper. This prototype explores whether UX can improve completion and clarity.

---

## The problem

Abstract frameworks often fail because they are hard to apply. Reflection tools need structure and momentum to stay useful.

---

## The hypothesis

Guided interaction and visual grouping increase follow-through and insight compared to static worksheets.

---

## What this prototype tests

• Whether users complete reflective exercises more often  
• How drag and drop grouping affects thinking  
• How phrasing values as actions changes perception  
• Where users hesitate or abandon the flow

---

## What this is not

• Not therapy software  
• Not a coaching platform  
• Not production hardened

It is an experiment in applied thinking.

---

## Current status

Functional prototype focused on UX flow and interaction design.

## Why this exists

I translate abstract ideas into working software to test whether they hold up in practice. This project explores how decision quality tools behave when made interactive.

Built to test an idea, not to ship a product.
